PowerShell - Create a new Resource Group with Tagging and adding a budget

#Set your focus to the target subscription:
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName $SubscriptionName

#Create the new resource group in a target location with tagging
New-AzResourceGroup `
-Name $resourcegroupname `
-Location $Location `   
-Tag @{Application="<value1>"; `
TechnicalOwner="<value2>"; `
WorkloadCriticality="<value3>"; `
Environment="<value4>";}

#Part 1 – create an action group with the email recipient who will receive the budget notifications / emails.
(This section only works on an EA subscription when using PowerShell)

$email1 = New-AzActionGroupReceiver `
-EmailAddress username@doman.com `
-Name AppCosts01
$ActionGroupId = (Set-AzActionGroup -ResourceGroupName resourcegroupname01 `
-Name AppCosts01 `
-ShortName AppCosts01 `
-Receiver $email1).Id
#Part 2 – create the budget on the resource group
New-AzConsumptionBudget -ResourceGroupName resourcegroupname01 `
-Amount 100 ` 			
-Name AppCosts01 `
-Category Cost `
-TimeGrain Monthly `
-StartDate 2022-11-01 `		
-EndDate 2030-05-31 `		
-ContactEmail username@doman.com  `
-NotificationKey Key1 `
-NotificationThreshold 10 `
-NotificationEnabled `
-ContactGroup $ActionGroupId

<#
*Location = if you are unsure of the region or need to verify the region then you can use Get-AzLocation | ft which will present the the primary region as well as the paired region in a neat readable table as shown below in figure "Get-AzLocation"
*Amount = is the currency as per your allocated budget
* Startdate is very important - make the date as new as possible eg the first date of the current month. A very old back dated date will cause the script to fail!
*End date - I make the end date sufficiently far ahead into the future so as to reduce overhead.
*NotificationThreshold - This is the only current limitation
